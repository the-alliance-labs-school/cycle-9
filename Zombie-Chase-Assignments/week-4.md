# Week 4 Assignment

## Description

Your assignment this week is to make a copy of your assignment from last week and wrap some of your elements inside <div> tags. Add some Classes or IDs to those <div> tags and target them to mess with the borders, margin, spacing, width and height and display by way of an external stylesheet file. Your two files are then to be submitted to your personal folder within a week 4 subfolder. The assignment is due at **5pm next Monday, October 28th**. The latest a request for an extension can be made will be **8 hours before the deadline** except for extenuating circumstances.
