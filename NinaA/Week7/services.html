            <p class="card-text">Flower gets its name from being the seed-bearing part of the plant and is the most well-known form of marijuana. A flower is a bud that opens and when fertilized produces some type of fruit with seeds in it. In marijuana, this part is also where the highest concentration of THC is found. There are only two base types of plant strains of cannabis: Indica or Sativa. However, there are hundreds or more crossbreeds of the two with some strains of a flower having a THC content of 30 to 35 percent.

              The flower is traditionally dried, and the bud is separated by breaking away the stems, leaves, and seeds. The flower is then consumed using a pipe, wrapped in a paper like a cigarette (commonly referred to as “a joint”), water bong, or vaporizers.</p>

            <p> To be very honest, I am a first timer. Customer service was great, they were able to guide me through the many options there is. 
              Once I received my product it was an amazing experience. Definitely will be a returning customer. I would recommend Nina's Once Stop Shop
            for their amazing customer service & spectacular product. </p>
