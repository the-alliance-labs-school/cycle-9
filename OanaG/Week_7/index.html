        <h3>The story of your baby and you</h3>
        <p>Your new little one has arrived and life has changed forever. We capture the milestones of your baby's life.  My newborn sessions are unique and special in that not only include precious images of baby, but they also include YOU and the other special members of your family. These are the images they want to remember the most.  The connection between you and your little one is so precious and so intimate.   </p>
