    <p>Kakuma refugee camp in north-western Kenya, girls are empowered by their new-found passion for computer coding.Every day is a hot day in Kakuma refugee camp, located in the arid desert of north-western Kenya. Underneath a blue sky, three girls in gingham school uniforms gather together. The camp is home to more than 186,000 residents who are primarily from the Horn and Great Lakes region of Africa. Originally from Burundi, South Sudan, and Somalia, their backgrounds vary widely. Their ambitions may lead them to divergent futures as well; one wants to be a journalist, another a software engineer, and the thirda poet. But right now, they share a common interest that they are very excited about computer coding. Umohoza Hurlarain, Nyamam Gai Gatluak, and Mumina Khalif are learning computer programming at the Angelina Jolie Primary School in Kakuma. The Angelina Jolie School is the only boarding school for girls in the camp, and it is in high demand. Last year about 500 girls competed for 60 spots.
